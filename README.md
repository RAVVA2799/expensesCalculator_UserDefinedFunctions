🚀 Python Expense & Vehicle Tax Calculation Projects
This repository contains Python-based projects that help users calculate salaries, monthly expenses, and vehicle tax using user-defined functions. These scripts provide an interactive command-line interface (CLI) for efficient financial and tax calculations.

📌 Projects Overview
1️⃣ Salary Calculation (python1.py)
🔹 Calculates gross salary based on a user's basic salary.
🔹 Includes Direct Allowance (40%) and House Rent Allowance (10%).
🔹 Ensures valid input and prevents incorrect salary values.

2️⃣ Monthly Expense Tracker (python2.py)
🔹 Helps users track expenses based on their monthly income.
🔹 Calculates the remaining balance or borrowed amount based on expenses.
🔹 Includes rent, food, electricity, phone, and cable bills.

3️⃣ Vehicle Tax & On-Road Price Calculator (python3.py)
🔹 Calculates on-road price for private (P) and business (B) vehicles.
🔹 Computes vehicle tax, insurance, and weight tax dynamically.
🔹 Analyzes multiple vehicles to find:

Vehicle with highest on-road price.
Vehicle with least weight.
Vehicles above a given budget or weight threshold.

🛠️ Future Enhancements
✅ Add GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt.
✅ Store data using SQLite or JSON instead of in-memory values.
✅ Support multiple expense categories dynamically.
